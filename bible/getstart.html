    illustrate themes of love:</span>
<p>These stories from the New Testament highlight different aspects of love, <br> including compassion, forgiveness, mercy, and unconditional acceptance.</p>
<br>
<span style="color: blue;">1. The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Story:</b>
<br>
<br>
A lawyer once asked Jesus, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <br>
 Jesus responded with a question, “What is written in the Law?”  <br>The lawyer answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart <br> and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind,’ <br> and ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’” Jesus told him he had answered correctly.
 <br>
 <br>


But the lawyer, wanting to justify himself, asked, “And who is my neighbor?” <b></b> Jesus replied with the parable of the Good Samaritan. <br> A man was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and left him half-dead. <br> A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. <br> So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. <br>
<br>


But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was, and when he saw him, he took pity on him. <br> He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. <br> Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. <br> The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. <br> “Look after him,” he said, “and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.” <br>
<br>
Jesus then asked, “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” The lawyer replied, <br> “The one who had mercy on him.” Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.” <br>

    2. The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32)</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Story:</b>
<br>
<br>
Jesus told the parable of a man who had two sons. <br> The younger son asked his father for his share of the estate, which the father granted. <br> The younger son then left for a distant country and squandered his wealth in wild living. <br> After he had spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he began to be in need. <br> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. <br> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. <br>
<br>
When he came to his senses, he said, “How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, <br> and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: <br> ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
<br>  I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’” So he got up and went to his father.
<br>
<br>
But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; <br> he ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. The son said to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. <br> I am no longer worthy to be called your son.” <br>
<br>

But the father said to his servants, “Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. <br> Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. <br> For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” So they began to celebrate. <br>
<br>

Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. <br> When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. <br> “Your brother has come,” he replied, “and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.” <br>
<br>
The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. <br> But he answered his father, “Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. <br> Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. <br> But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!” <br>
<br>
“My son,” the father said, “you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. <br> But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” <br>
<br>
<br>

This parable illustrates the unconditional love and forgiveness of God. <br> It highlights that no matter how far one strays, they are always welcomed back with open arms when they repent. <br> It also teaches about the importance of mercy and forgiveness, even towards those who have wronged us.

3. Jesus and the Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>Story:</b>
<br>
<br>
Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, <br>where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. <br> The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. <br> They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <br> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” <br> They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. <br>
<br>
But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. <br> When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, <br> “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <br>
<br>
At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. <br> Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” <br>

“No one, sir,” she said. <br> <br>

<b style="color: blue;">“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. 
    “Go now and leave your life of sin.”</b>
